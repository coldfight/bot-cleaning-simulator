# bot-cleaning-simulator
A bot cleaning simulator. You provide a map in a textarea. It will generate the map in an HTML5 canvas, and a bot will try to visit all possible tiles and provide some stats.

This is based off of a programming test that I did years ago. I had a lot of fun doing it and thought I'd bring it over and expand on it.
